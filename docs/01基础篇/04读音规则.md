[TOC]



## 1.连读

> **连读的条件**
>
> 相邻的两词在意义上必须密切相关，同属一个意群。连读所构成的音节一般都不重读，只需顺其自然地一带而过，不可读得太重。

###      (1)辅+元 连读

> ​            连读在同一个意群里，如果相邻两词中的前一个词是以辅音结尾，后一个词是以元音开头，这就要将辅音与元音拼起来连读。

I’m~an~English boy.

It~is~an~old book.

Let me have~a look~at~it.

Ms Blackworkedin~an~officeyesterday.

Put~it~on,please.

Not~at~all.

Please pick~it~up.

take~it~all  

with~a friend~of mine

**闪音** [k]=>[g]  [t]=[d]
	**闪音又叫浊化(美音特有的) 例如**
apple   [p]=>[b] 

started
a pair of
in the middle of

### (2)“r/re+元音”型连读 

> 如果前一个词是以-r或者-re结尾，后一个词是以元音开头，这时的r或re不但要发/r/，而且还要与后面的元音拼起来连读。

 They’re my father~and mother.

I looked for~it here~and there.

There~is a football under~it.

There~are some books on the desk.

Here~is a letter for you.

Here~are four~eggs.

But where~is my cup?

Where~are your brother~and sister?

**但是，如果一个音节的前后都有字母r，即使后面的词以元音开头，也不能连读**。

The black clouds are coming nearer and nearer.（nearer与and不可连读） 

**当短语或从句之间按意群进行停顿时，意群与意群之间即使有两个相邻的辅音与元音出现，也不可连读。**

Is~it a~hat or a cat?（hat与or之间不可以连读）

There~is~a good book in my desk. （book与in之间不可以连读）

Can you speak~English or French? （English与or之间不可以连读）

Shall we meet at~eight or ten tomorrow morning? （meet与 at，eight与or之间不可以连读）

She opened the door and walked~in. （door与and之间不可以连读）

### (3)“辅音+半元音”型连读 

> 英语语音中的/j/和/w/是半元音，如果前一个词是以辅音结尾，后一个词是以半元音，特别是/j/开头，此时也要连读。

eg. Thank~you.

Nice to meet~you.

Did~you get there late~again?

Would~you like~a cup~of tea？

Could~you help me, please?

> “音的同化”—常把/d/+/j/读成/dV/，did you听上成了/dIdVu/，would you成了 /wudVu/，could you成了 /kudVu/。

###      (4)元+元 连读 

> 如果前一个词以元音结尾，后一个词以元音开头，这两个音往往也要自然而不间断地连读到一起。

I~am Chinese.

He~is very friendly to me.

She wants to study~English.

How~and why did you come here?

She can’t carry~it.

It’ll take you three~hours to walk there.

The question is too~easy for him to answer.

## 2.失去爆破

> ​     6个爆破音有3对/p/，/b/; /t/，/d/; /k/，/g/
>
> 失去爆破，又叫不完全爆破，就是在某些情况下，只须做出发音的准备，但并不发音，稍稍停顿后就发后面的音。

### (1) “爆破音+爆破音”型

> 6个爆破音中的任意2个相临时，前一个爆破音会失去爆破，即由相关的发音器官做好这个发音的姿势，稍做停顿后即发后面的爆破

eg. The girl in the re(d) coat was on a bla(ck) bike jus(t) now.

The bi(g) bus from the fa(c) tory is full of people.

Wha(t) time does he get up every morning?

This is an ol(d) pi(c)ture of a bi(g) car.

The ol(d) do(c)tor has a ca(t), too.

We’re going to work on a farm nex(t) Tuesday.

What would you like, ho(t) tea or bla(ck) coffee?

It’s a very col(d) day, but it’s a goo(d) day.

You can put i(t) down in the bi(g) garden.

I bought a chea(p) book, but it’s a goo(d) book.

###      (2)“爆破音+摩擦音”型

> 如果前面是爆破音，其后紧跟着某些摩擦音（如/f/，/s/，/W/，/T/等），那么前面那个爆破音仅有十分轻微的爆破，而后面那个摩擦音则要完全爆破。

eg. 

Goo(d) morning, Mr. Bell.

Uncle Li’s fa(c)tory is qui(te) near to the cinema.

I wen(t) there alone a(t) nine las(t) night.

-Do you know his bi(ke) number? -Sorry, I don’(t) know.

The forty-firs(t) lesson is qui(te) difficult.

Goo(d) luck, Lin Tao.

​     

## 三、浊化

### (1)[S] 后面的清辅音要浊化

eg. discussion： [c] 浊化成 [g]

stand： [t] 浊化成[d]

expression： [p]浊化成 [b]



### (2)美音中：[t] 在单词的中间被浊化成[d]

如： writer，听起来和 rider 的发音几乎没有区别

letter—ladder

> 美国人和加拿大人发音为了省事，习惯清音浊化，尤其是[t]在单词的中间一定会浊化成[d]， 但英国人发音不会这样，这也是英音和美音的一大区别。了解这一浊化原则，会给听力带来一些帮助。



## 四、弱读

一般来说： 实词重读，如动词、名词、副词等；

虚词弱读，如介词、代词等。

弱读的规则一般是：元音音节弱化成 [E]，如单词 for, from, to, some, am, do, have, does

强式 [fC:] [frC:m] [tU:] [sQm] [Am] [dU:] [hAv] [dQz]

弱式 [f[] [fr[m] [t[] [s[m] [[m] [d[] [h[v] [d[z]



## 五、英音和美音的差异

由于美音的流行，四级考试听力也以美音为主，但是，由于历史的原因，我国大多数英语教师的发音，仍然以英音为主，所以，我们脑海中根深蒂固的英式发音，可能和磁带中的发音不一致，进而造成四级听力中的障碍。英语和美语在读音上的差异主要反映在元音字母a, o 和辅音字母r 的不同读音上。

在ask, can't, dance, fast, path 这一类的单词中，英国人将字母a 读作[a:]，而美国人则读作[æ]，所以这些词在美国人口中就成了[Ask][kAnt][dAns][fAst]和[pB:W]。
